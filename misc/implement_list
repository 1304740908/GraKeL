Current:
- Lovasz θ graph kernel
- SVM θ graph kernel

Archive:
- Calculates the full graphlet kernel
  as proposed by Shervashidze and Vishwanathan (2009)
  for graphlets of size 3,4,5

TOSOLVE:
- overflow error for some executions of the 
- maximum_recursion_depth error for subgraph matching:
    define formula in better detail

TODO:
- correct the build frame work
- unit test by asserting the existing values
- add new kernels to graph_kernels.py
