We have measured the running time of *GraKeL*'s kernels on several datasets, and we present the results below.
We experimented with the following 16 kernels: (1) vertex histogram kernel (VH), (2) random walk kernel (RW), (3) shortest path kernel (SP), (4) Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel (WL-VH), (5) Weisfeiler-Lehman shortest path kernel (WL-SP), (6) Weisfeiler-Lehman pyramid match kernel (WL-PM), (7) neighborhood hash kernel (NH), (8) neighborhood subgraph pairwise distance kernel (NSPDK), (9) ordered decompositional DAGs with subtree kernel (ODD-STh), (10) pyramid match kernel (PM), (11) GraphHopper kernel (GH), (12) subgraph matching kernel (SM), (13) propagation kernel (PK), (14) multiscale Laplacian kernel (ML), (15) core Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel (CORE-WL), (16) core shortest path kernel (CORE-SP). Note that some of the kernels (e.g., WL-SP, CORE-SP) correspond to frameworks applied to graph kernels. We evaluated the kernels on standard graph classification datasets. Some datasets contain unlabeled graphs, other datasets contain node-labeled graphs, while there are also datasets that contain node-attributed graphs. Since some kernels can handle different types of graphs than others, we conduct three distinct experiments. The three experiments are characterized by the types of graphs contained in the employed datasets: (1) datasets with unlabeled graphs, (2) datasets with node-labeled graphs, and (3) datasets with node-attributed graphs. Note that kernels that are designed for node-labeled graphs can also be applied to unlabaled graphs by initializing the node labels of all vertices of the unlabaled graphs to the same value. Hence, we evaluate these kernels on datasets that contain node-labeled graphs, but also on datasets that contain unlabeled graphs. Moreover, kernels that are designed for node-attributed graphs can be applied to unlabeled graphs and to graphs that contain dicrete node labels.

In all cases, to perform graph classification, we employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We performed 10-fold cross-validation, and within each fold, the parameter :math:`C` of the SVM and the hyperparameters of the kernels were chosen based on a validation experiment on a single :math:`90\%-10\%` split of the training data. Furthermore, the whole process was repeated 10 times in order to exclude random effects of the fold assignments. All kernel matrices were normalized.

All experiments were performed on a cluster of 80 Intel Xeon CPU E7-4860 @ 2.27GHz with 1TB RAM. Each kernel was computed on a single thread of the cluster. We set a time limit of 24 hours for each kernel to compute the kernel matrix. Hence, we denote by TIMEOUT kernel computations that did not finish within one day. We also set a memory limit of 64GB, and we denote by OUT-OF-MEM computations that exceeded this limit. Given a kernel and a dataset, the running time of a single run is computed as follows: for each fold of a 10-fold cross-validation experiment, the running time of the kernel corresponds to the running time for the computation of the kernel matrix that performed best on the validation experiment. Then, we report the average running time of the 10 runs.

Similar to the labeled case, VH is again the fastest kernel on all datasets. The running time of PK, ODD-STh, and WL-VH is also low compared to the other kernels on most datasets. The SVM-θ, NH, PM, SP and CORE-WL kernels were also competitive in terms of running time. Besides achieving low accuracy levels, the Lo-θ kernel is also very computationally expensive. The RW, NSPDK, CORE-SP, WL-SP and GH are also very expensive in terms of running time. The above 6 kernels did not manage to calculate any kernel matrix on REDDIT-M-5K and REDDIT-M-12K within one day. The SM kernel failed to compute the kernel matrix on IMDB-B, IMDB-M and COLLAB within one day, while it exceeded the maximum available memory on the remaining three datasets. The WL-VH and CORE-WL kernels also exceeded the maximum available memory on REDDIT-M-5K and REDDIT-M-12K. It should be mentioned that these two datasets contain several thousands of graphs, while the size of the graphs is also large (i.e., several hundreds of vertices on average).

In terms of running time, PK is the most efficient kernel since it handled all datasets in less than two minutes. GH and ML are much slower than PK on all datasets. For instance, the average computation time of ML and GH was greater than 4 hours and 5 hours on PROTEINS_full, respectively. The SP and SM kernels, as already discussed, are very expensive in terms of running time, and hence, their usefulness in real-world problems is limited.
