Classification Examples
=======================

Examples that demonstrate through a standard classification problem by the use of an SVM with a precomputed kernel, the accuracy of various Graph Kernels (WL-Subtree, Shortest-Path, Multiscale-Laplacian, Lovasz/SVM-Theta) while using various measure settings (simple, manual K-Fold with Grid-Search, Pipeline Grid-search, or randomized K-folds).
